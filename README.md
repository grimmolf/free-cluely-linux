# Free Cluely

A desktop application to help you cheat on everything.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Multi-Monitor Support**: Select which monitor to capture screenshots from in dual/triple monitor setups
- **Multi-Provider AI**: Choose from Gemini, Red Hat Model as a Service, or Ollama (local)
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux (with enhanced Linux support)
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Quick screenshot capture and window management
- **Persistent Settings**: Monitor preferences and AI configuration saved between sessions

## üöÄ Quick Start Guide

### Prerequisites
- Make sure you have Node.js installed on your computer
- Git installed on your computer
- **Choose one AI model provider:**
  - **Google Gemini** (Recommended): Get API key from [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
  - **Red Hat Model as a Service**: Get API key from [Red Hat Developer Portal](https://developers.redhat.com/)
  - **Ollama** (Local/Free): Install [Ollama](https://ollama.ai) locally - no API key required

#### Linux Fedora Additional Requirements
For optimal performance on Linux Fedora, ensure you have:
- **`imagemagick` (REQUIRED for multi-monitor support)**: `sudo dnf install imagemagick`
- `gnome-screenshot` (optional fallback for single monitor)
- X11 or Wayland display server properly configured
- Required development tools: `sudo dnf install gcc-c++ make python3-devel`

**Note**: ImageMagick is essential for the multi-monitor screenshot feature. Without it, monitor selection will not work properly.

### Installation Steps

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone [repository-url]
cd free-cluely-linux
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Set up environment variables:
   - Copy the example environment file: `cp .env.example .env`
   - Edit the `.env` file and add your chosen provider's API key:
   ```bash
   # For Google Gemini (default)
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
   
   # For Red Hat Model as a Service
   REDHAT_API_KEY=your_redhat_api_key_here
   
   # For Ollama (no API key needed, just install Ollama)
   ```
   - Save the file

### Running the App

#### Method 1: Development Mode (Recommended for first run)
1. Open a terminal and run:
```bash
npm run dev -- --port 5180
```

2. Open another terminal in the same folder and run:
```bash
NODE_ENV=development npm run electron:dev
```

#### Method 2: Production Mode
```bash
npm run build
```
The built app will be in the `release` folder.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Once the app is running, you can configure various settings:

#### Model Provider Configuration

1. **Access Settings**: Click the ‚öôÔ∏è Settings button in the main interface
2. **Choose Provider**: Select from Gemini, Red Hat Model as a Service, or Ollama
3. **Configure Model**: Choose your preferred model (e.g., gemini-2.0-flash, llama3.1, etc.)
4. **Add API Key**: Enter your API key if required (not needed for Ollama)
5. **Save**: Click Save Configuration to apply changes

#### Screenshot Settings (Multi-Monitor Support)

**NEW**: Enhanced multi-monitor support for dual/triple monitor setups!

For users with multiple monitors:

1. **Access Settings**: Click the ‚öôÔ∏è Settings button
2. **Screenshot Settings**: Find the Screenshot Settings section
3. **Select Monitor**: Choose which monitor to capture screenshots from:
   - **"All Monitors (Default)"** - Captures from all monitors combined
   - **Individual monitor selection** - Captures only from the selected monitor (e.g., "Display 1 (1920x1080)")
4. **Save**: Click Save Settings to apply changes

**Key Benefits:**
- Capture screenshots from your active work monitor only
- Avoid capturing sensitive information from secondary monitors
- Better performance with focused screen capture
- Works with dual-monitor, triple-monitor, and extended display setups

**Technical Implementation:**
- Uses ImageMagick on Linux for reliable multi-monitor support
- Falls back to Electron's native screenshot API if needed
- Automatic display detection and enumeration

#### Provider-Specific Setup:

**Ollama (Local/Free)**:
```bash
# Install Ollama
curl -fsSL https://ollama.ai/install.sh | sh

# Pull a model (example: Llama 3.1)
ollama pull llama3.1

# Start Ollama (usually runs automatically)
ollama serve
```

**Red Hat Model as a Service**:
- Sign up at [Red Hat Developer Portal](https://developers.redhat.com/)
- Navigate to AI/ML services 
- Generate an API key
- Supports models like Llama 3.1, Mistral, and Phi-3

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **Closing the App**: 
   - Press `Cmd + Q` (Mac) or `Ctrl + Q` (Windows/Linux) to quit
   - Or use Activity Monitor/Task Manager to close `Interview Coder`
   - The X button currently doesn't work (known issue)

2. **If the app doesn't start**:
   - Make sure no other app is using port 5180
   - Try killing existing processes:
     ```bash
     # Find processes using port 5180
     lsof -i :5180
     # Kill them (replace [PID] with the process ID)
     kill [PID]
     ```

   **Linux Fedora specific troubleshooting**:
   - If screenshots aren't working, install required tools:
     ```bash
     # REQUIRED: For multi-monitor support
     sudo dnf install imagemagick
     
     # Optional fallbacks (only if ImageMagick fails):
     # For GNOME desktop environments
     sudo dnf install gnome-screenshot
     ```
   - If the window doesn't show properly, try:
     ```bash
     # Set X11 permissions (if using X11)
     xhost +local:
     # Or ensure proper Wayland permissions
     ```

   **Multi-Monitor Issues**:
   - **FIRST STEP**: Ensure ImageMagick is properly installed:
     ```bash
     # Install ImageMagick (essential for multi-monitor support)
     sudo dnf install imagemagick
     # Verify installation and display detection
     identify -list display
     ```
   - If monitor selection still isn't working:
     - **Restart the application completely** after installing ImageMagick
     - Check the app logs for "Screenshot error" or "Falling back to Electron" messages
     - Try selecting a specific monitor in Settings instead of "All Monitors"
   - If screenshots only capture the primary monitor:
     - Verify ImageMagick installation: `which convert` (should return a path)
     - Check Settings ‚Üí Screenshot Settings ‚Üí Select your desired monitor
     - The app will automatically fall back to Electron's native capture if ImageMagick fails
   - If no monitors appear in the settings dropdown:
     - Run in development mode to see detailed logs: `NODE_ENV=development npm run electron:dev`
     - Check console for "Electron displays:" and "Screenshot-desktop displays:" logs

3. **Keyboard Shortcuts**:
   - `Cmd/Ctrl + B`: Toggle window visibility
   - `Cmd/Ctrl + H`: Take screenshot
   - 'Cmd/Enter': Get solution
   - `Cmd/Ctrl + Arrow Keys`: Move window

### Troubleshooting

If you see errors:
1. Delete the `node_modules` folder
2. Delete `package-lock.json`
3. Run `npm install` again
4. Try running the app again using Method 1
